- **A mechanism for the team to easily log practice dive data via a web app (phone, iPad preferred). Dive data should include:**

  - Diver information
  - Date/time of the dive
  - Dive identifier (identifying dive numbers):
    - All dives are identified by three or four digits and one letter.
      - `first digit` = dive group
      - `second digit` = initial position/direction
      - `third digit` = number of half somersaults
      - `fourth digit` = number of half twists
      - `letter` = body position
  - Whether the attempt was a baulk/balk
  - Degree of difficulty (DD) rating for the dive
  - Execution rating for the dive

- **The ability for a coach to administer coaching/training protocols for each diver.**

  - Possible options of type of correction, phase of correction, and severity
  - Place for coaching notes

- **The automated availability of competition data from divemeets.com.**

- **A dashboard for tracking dive performance in practice versus in competition.**

  - Average score in practice and competition for different dives
  - Review progress on training improvements

- **[Nice to have] A dashboard for analyzing divemeet.com data for recruiting**
